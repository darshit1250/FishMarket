# Fish Species Prediction
  With the help of different dimensions of a fish such as Weight, Length 1, Length 2, Length 3, Height, and Width the model predicts to which species it belongs.
  
# Description
  Source of the dataset is kaggle.
  The dataset contains 159 rows with 7 colums including Species,	Weight,	Length1,	Length2,	Length3,	Height, and	Width.
  The dataset has no null values.
  I've used RandomForest classifier to solve this problem.
  
# How to install?
  The project contains total 6 files with already build pickle file, html-css, fish_classification.ipynb, Procfile and requirements.txt for heroku.
  The project is already deployed on Heroku platform and here is the link: https://fish-market-prediction.herokuapp.com/
